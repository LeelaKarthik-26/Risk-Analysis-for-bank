# üè¶ Banking Data Analysis and Dashboard Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of customer banking data using:
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards

It is designed to help stakeholders understand customer behaviors, financial product usage, and demographic patterns that can drive data-driven decisions in the banking sector.

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

Performed using `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`. Key steps include:

- Data cleaning: handling missing values and duplicates
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Correlation heatmaps
- Insights on:
  - Job-wise product usage
  - Age vs. balance trends
  - Marital status and product adoption
